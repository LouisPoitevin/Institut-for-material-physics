first hand on experiment. 
sample --> Titanium Chromium
            already polished, cleaned on polishing paper 1µm ø 

Software : 
  PSTrace

experiment setup : 
  - counter electrod --> palladium wire
  - reference electrode --> potassium chloride solution/silver chloride
  - working electrode --> sample
  - solution --> PBS (phosphate buffered saline)
  - study temperature --> 37.5°C - control by thermostat

measures : 
  - open circuit potential determination
  - electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (0.1Hz --> 10,000Hz | E_dc = -0.360V | E_ac = 0.01V)
  - polarization curve (E_corr ~ -0.363V)
  - electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (0.1Hz --> 10,000Hz | E_dc = -0.234V | E_ac = 0.01V)
  - polarization curve
